						&emsp; My name is Rafael Manzanares, and I am currently attending<br>
						James Madison University's school of Architecture. I am open to<br>
						most forms of architecture, but the one that I have interest in<br>
						is residential, and that's why I am interested in companies that<br>
						have a focus on Residential architecture. Iâ€™ve gained much of my<br>
						experience through using softwares, such as AutoCAD, Sketchup,<br>
						Photoshop and Illustrator, which has allowed me to showcase my<br>
						abilities in the classroom. Those skills involved me using different<br>
						types of scales, creating various prototypes, drawings and 3D models.<br>
						These skills have not only accelerated my learning with technical<br>
						and drawing designs, but also with my non-technical skills like<br>
						time, task, and creativity.
