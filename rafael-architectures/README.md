Create a static website for a client using HTML and CSS. A static website is one whose content is baked into the HTML. This is in contrast to a dynamic website whose content is generated flexibly JavaScript and queries to web services. You will create a dynamic website later. You will create a website with a focused theme and audience of your choosing. Your site might serve a student group, a relative whoâ€™s planning a wedding, a business, or an artist who needs a portfolio. The site must serve someone besides yourself. A large part of web design is thinking empathetically, and this requirement makes that explicit.

Our website serves the purpose of Rafael Manzanares, an architecture major at JMU. This website is to showcase his accomplishments throughout his JMU career
