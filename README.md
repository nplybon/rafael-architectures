Create a static website for a client using HTML and CSS. A static website is one whose content is baked into the HTML. This is in contrast to a dynamic website whose content is generated flexibly JavaScript and queries to web services. You will create a dynamic website later. You will create a website with a focused theme and audience of your choosing. Your site might serve a student group, a relative whoâ€™s planning a wedding, a business, or an artist who needs a portfolio. The site must serve someone besides yourself. A large part of web design is thinking empathetically, and this requirement makes that explicit.
