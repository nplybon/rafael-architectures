							My name is Rafael Manzanares, and I am currently attending
							James Madison University's school of Architecture. I am open to
							most forms of architecture, but the one that I have interest in
							is residential, and that's why I am interested in companies that
							have a focus on Residential architecture. Iâ€™ve gained much of my
							experience through using softwares, such as AutoCAD, Sketchup,
							Photoshop and Illustrator, which has allowed me to showcase my
							abilities in the classroom. Those skills involved me using different
							types of scales, creating various prototypes, drawings and 3D models.
							These skills have not only accelerated my learning with technical
							and drawing designs, but also with my non-technical skills like
							time, task, and creativity.
