				About Me
			</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="gmain">
			<p>My name is Rafael Manzanares, and I am currently attending James Madison University's school of
				Architecture. I am open to most forms of architecture, but the one that I have interest in 
				is residential, and that's why I am interested in companies that have a focus on Residential architecture.
				Iâ€™ve gained much of my experience through using softwares, such as AutoCAD, Sketchup, Photoshop and
				Illustrator, which has allowed me to showcase my abilities in the classroom. Those skills involved me using
				different types of scales, creating various prototypes, drawings and 3D models. These skills have
				not only accelerated my learning with technical and drawing designs, but also with my
				non-technical skills like time, task, and creativity.
